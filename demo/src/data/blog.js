    body :  "Some background Before I started all this journey in learning web development, \
    I was passionate to write and teaching people about the things I've learned (and still, this\
    blog is the proof).I work on a big company that has created several applications, and \
    customers use them as a service (SaaS) and I work providing technical support to customers, \
    filling out bugs, reporting issues, or guiding customers to configure their service as their \
    use case.In that type of job, you can find smart team members who, that as side projects, \
    they create small applications, services, or browser extensions to make our work easier. \
    Some of my team members have created smart scripts to automatically send emails, a case comment \
    generator, or a tool with KPIs and metrics but to deploy those tools to our colleagues in the company,\
    they needed to create a user guide, and they struggle with it.\
    Discussing that with a Sr. engineer, he told me that developers don't like to document,\
    it's tedious and that was an interesting fact I knew about developers. Do you feel identified with that?"
